identifier: "CVE-2020-28476"
package_slug: "pypi/tornado"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "All versions of package tornado are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning
  by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query
  parameters using a semicolon (`;`), they can cause a difference in the interpretation
  of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server.
  This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the
  proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not
  include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter."
