identifier: CVE-2019-19844
package_slug: pypi/Django
title: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password
description: Django allows
  account takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that is equal to an existing
  user's email address after case transformation of Unicode characters) would allow
  an attacker to be sent a password reset token for the matched user account. (One
  mitigation in the new releases is to send password reset tokens only to the registered
  user email address.)
